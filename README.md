## Introduction

My mommy and me blog was designed to displayed simple recipes for parents with their children. The site's focus is to allow users to share their recipes and experiences for other users to read and use. I got the inspiration in my 4-years-old daughter, she doesn't go to preschool once a month, and she calls our time together: "My mommy and me".

Users will also be able to comment on recipes, and upload their own images. They can like or unlike the recipe.

This is the fourth of five projects for completing the Full Stack Software Development program at the Code Institute.

### Development Plans

To create an appeling website with a great UX and UI, the developer make a research throughout the best cooking blogs, with the best and worst features.

#### Strategy
- **Roles**
    - User
    - Admin

- **Demographic**
    - Parents
    - Cooking Enthusiasts

- **Psycographics**
    - Personality & Attitude:
        - Patient
        - Creative
        - Curious
    - Values:
        - Love for quality time in family
    - Lifestyle:
        - Parents
        - Interested in homemade food

The website needs to enable the *user* to:
- search for recipes.
- make comments to a recipe.
- like and unlike recipes.
- upload images from their experiences when adding a recipe.
- register and log in to participate in the blog.
- save recipes to a favorite page.

The website needs to enable the *admin* to:
- Create drafts for finishing later.

#### Scope
the scope was defined to be able to determine the work that needed to be done in terms of the features and of the strategies described.

- *Content Requirements*
The user will be expecting:
    - A comprehensive list of recipes.
    - A detailed list with ingredients and procedure.
    - A list of comments.
    - A page to find the saved recipes.

- *Functionality Requirements*
The user will be able to:
    - Navigate the site easily.
    - Select recipes for trying.
    - Add comments to every recipe.
    - Like or unlike recipes.


#### Structure

#### Skeleton
balsamiq wireframes

### Design

#### Color Scheme
The colors were chosen for a soft look of the website and focusing mainly on the images. The terra cotta gives a warm sensation and the cultured color gives a clean and clear sensation without overwhelming the user.

#### Typography
The font chosen for the heading tags was 'Architects Daughter' as it is a cool and soft typography, and for the rest of the text was 'Open Sans' as it is clear and concise for big texts.

#### Imagery
To match the color scheme, the default images for the recipes and the hero image were chosen to complement each other.
